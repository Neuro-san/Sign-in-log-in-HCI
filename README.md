**Technology stacks:**
HTML: Defines the structure and elements of the trash bin interface.
CSS: Styles the UI components, layouts, animations, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Manages interactive behaviors like sensor status updates, alerts, and simulated automation features.

**Running the Prototype Locally:**
Step 1: Download or clone the project repository to your local machine (Source file).
Step 2: Open the 'Source file' folder (preferably in VSCode).
Step 3: Open website.html in your preferred live server or browser.
Step 4: Interact with the prototype interface to test features such as automatic lid opening, sensor status, and alerts simulated using JavaScript.

Note: HTML, CSS, and JS should be in a single folder before running or opening in the live server.
